The aim of the Project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, cleaning and perform predictions from the Credit Card Dataset.

Based on the Problem statement target variable, we can conclude that we should use classification algorithm in this project.

Imported various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib into Google Collab and Readed the insurance dataset using read_csv() function and merged the both datasets. We gone ahead in observing the dataset's unique values in every column separately.

While observing every column separately, we observed the values which are wrongly typed or in some values in which the values should be dropped, we cleaned the data accordingly. We checked the data for null values and filled that with appropriate values like mean, median and mode which better fits that column.
